Interactive-eBay-Listing-Template
=================================

A small custom JavaScript framework and HTML/CSS template for custom, interactive eBay listings.

It is of course possible to include jQuery in an eBay listing if you're clever, but it's also explicitly in violation of their policies. jQuery is also probably overkill for something as simple as an eBay listing. This little framework makes writing behaviors in vanilla JS a bit easier, and doesn't violate any of eBay's policies.
